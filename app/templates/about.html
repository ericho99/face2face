	<h4>Face2Face is a revolutionary application that will disrupt cooking as we know it. The company's origin story has since become the stuff of legends; one day, Yale Junior Computer Science Major Eric Ho, as he sat in his room wishing he could cook more than ramen and eggs, wished he could ONLY see what other, more accomplished chefs were doing at the moment. Meanwhile Brian, an accomplished cook, sat in HIS room wishing that someone would pay him for livestreaming the dinner he would cook EVERY night. The next day, the two met at the local night club and realized that they had a possible multi-billion dollar idea–unfortunately they had no idea how to "code." Luckily, at that moment, a stumbling David Roeca ran into them and spilled his non-alchoholic drink all over Eric's knockoff Gucci shirt. At first Eric was mad, but when he saw that David was wearing a StackOverflow fanny pack, he realized that David was a "real" hacker. David thought that the idea was great and they ordered some drinks to celebrate–however, since David was allergic to soy beans, he made sure to tell the bartender that he couldn't drink soy. However the bartender misheard him and found a girl named Soy because he thought she was their friend. They explained their idea to her and she thought it was great and joined the team. Then they found a guy named Tony and the rest is history.</h4>
